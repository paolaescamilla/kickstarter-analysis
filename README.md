# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns


## Overview of the Project
The following analysis aims to uncover trends and opportunities for Louise to better plan and execute her kickstarter campaigns. 

### Background
Louise is a young entrepreneur who, since 2009, has been organizing and launching campaigns to bring cultural events to the general public. Her campaigns include a different variety of categories and subcategories and, since she has never done an analysis of the performance of each, wants an analysis that can expose the performance achieved so far so she can better plan, execute and focus her coming campaigns.

### Analysis methodology
The analysis was performed using the tool Microsoft Excel. A complete clean database was received from Louise which was arranged in format. The data set was already clean but it still implied an additional revision to guarantee formatting. 

After a review of the information, it was concluded that additional data could be retrieved from the information provided so additional columns were created to display such information.

The analysis was supported by the use of filters, formulas, conditional formatting, pivot tables and graphs for a clearer visualization. 

## Challenges
The main challenges encountered were found around the use of formulas and pivot tables. 

### Formulas
For the formulas, certain mistakes were done in the main formula and therefore dragged along the column. This action demanded more time to search for the possible flaw and research on how to correct it. 

### Pivot tables
As for pivot tables, the fairly new exposure to the tool demanded the investment of greater attention and time to make sure the most suitable information was displayed in the proper axis. 

## Results

### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
Analyzing the category theater by outcome and launch date it was noticed that without a doubt the month of May is the best month for Louise to launch a theater campaign. She had a total of 111 successful campaigns out of the 166 she launched. 

A second conclusion that is drawn is that December is the least ideal month for Louise to start a theater campaign. Her successful campaigns almost match the total given for failed campaigns. This could potentially be due to the fact that the month coincides with the end of the theater season and therefore there is not as much interest to contribute to a campaign.

### Outcomes based on Goals
When analyzing the outcomes of the theater campaigns based on the goals it is noticed that:

*All theater campaigns with a goal of between $45,000 and $49,999 failed in 100%. 
*From the theater campaigns with a goal of between $25,000 and $29,000, 80% of those failed while 20% succeeded. This is mentioned so Louise can keep in mind that this range of goal is highly risky.
*The theater campaigns with the highest success rate, of 67%, was found within a goal of $35,000 to $44,999.

### Limitations
Some limitations of this dataset were found I the following:
The deadlines and launch dates were given in epoch timestamp. This requested to dedicate time to transform time into a readable format. 
The dataset was initially incomplete in information. Therefore additional columns were added, using the information provided, to support the analysis. 

### Other Visualization Possibilities
It is recommended the use of bar graphs to further explore other trends. Also, a box and whiskers table can be developed to learn more about possible outliers in the information. Lastly, more pivot tables can be developed using some other columns as possibility to uncover trends in other countries, in other categories/subcategories and specific names of campaigns.
